**NLP - Natural Language Processing**
**/** **Deep Learning**

What is NLP ?

- NLP is Natural Language Processing. Let us assume a simple use case where we want to detect either the email is spam
  or not and this we want to do with the help of machine learning.
- For the email detection we have some rules like Subject, Body, Sender etc.
- Machine can not detect the language directly from the email. We need some conversion which machine can understand and
  process our data.
- Here, NLP comes into the picture to convert the human language to machine language. NLP is a process that we use to
  convert natural/human languages to vectors. And we these vectors further for processing.
- It is not just with the text, it could be any type of data that we want to process.

**Road Map per Generations**
:-)  As more you down, the accuracy will get improve and Size of the model will get increase.

1. Text Preprocessing (Cleaning the Input)
    1. Tokenization (Convert bigger data to smaller chunks)
    2. Lemmatization
    3. Stemming
    4. Stopwords

2. Text Preprocessing (Converting data to vector)
    1. Bag Of Words (BOW)
    2. TFIDF
    3. Uni grams
    4. Bigrams

3. Text Preprocessing
    1. Word2Vec
    2. AVGWord2Vec

**Deep Learning**

4. Text Preprocessing (Neural Network)
    1. RNN
    2. LSTM RNN
    3. GRU RNN
5. Text Preprocessing
    1. Word Embedding
6. Advance
    1. Transformer
    2. Bert

**We have libraries for machine learning like Pytorch (Created by Facebook)/ TensorFlow(Created by Google)**
