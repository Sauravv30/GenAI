# Lemmatization

Lemmatization is required to overcome the problems of stemming
It basically works with the **help** of **WordNet CorpusReader**
**Wordnet Lemmatizer**

- It is slower because it compare the words with dictionary
- This technique is like a stemming. The output we will get after lemmatization is called lemma. Which is a root word
  rater then root stem, the output of stemming. After lemmatization, we will be getting a valid word that means the same
  thing.
