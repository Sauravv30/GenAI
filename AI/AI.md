# AI (Artificial Intelligence)

- Build application that can perform its own task without human intervention.
    * Netflix (Recommendation)
    * Self-driving car

# Machine Learning

- Machine learning is subset of AI. It is a stats tool to understand the data.
    * Statical analysis
    * Visualization
    * Prediction
    * Forecasting

# Deep Learning

- Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It is a try to mimic human brain, it multilayered neural network

    * ANN
    * CNN and object detection -> Computer vision
    * RNN and variants -> Text related vision, Time Series

- Models
    * Discriminative
        * Classification, Prediction : Trained on labeled dataset
    * Generative (LLM, LIM)
        * New data trained on huge dataset.
